## Introduction
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.

## What you should already know
- A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
- Good working knowledge of HTML.
- Some programming experience.

## JavaScript and Java
JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in others.

## Hello World
```javascript
function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");
```
## Variable Scope

When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable.

## Global Variables

Global variables are properties of the global object.

## Constants

You can create a read-only, named constant with the `const` keyword.

## Data Types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

- Boolean
- null
- undefined
- Number
- String
- Symbol
- Object

## If...else Statement

Use the `if` statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional `else` clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.

## While Statement

A `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

## Function Declaration

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the `function` keyword, followed by:

- The name of the function.
- A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets.
